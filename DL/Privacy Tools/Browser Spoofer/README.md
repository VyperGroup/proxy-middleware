# BrowserSpoofer

This will be a Middleware that allow you to choose a browser to spoof. Unlike UA spoofers, it will also spoof the upcoming [User-Agent Client Hints](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#http-ua-hints). Finally, it will trick [feature detection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Feature_detection#the_concept_of_feature_detection) into intentionally failing if the browser you choose to spoof doesn't support it.
