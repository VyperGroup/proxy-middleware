# README

## WARNING

It would be best to leave this repo and not interact with it now. The other Markdown documents must be completed more to be considered a draft. Trust me, you don't want to be here.

Do not consider using any of this code in production at this moment! It is the most prototypical collection of software in existence. These are primarily placeholders right now, and they should only be read for a rough idea of what is to come for experienced proxy developers who want to understand where I will take my projects with my proxy middleware standard. Everything here is a draft with no builds, nor is a build configuration provided. Some of the middleware featured in this repository still reflects aspects of the legacy unstandardized proprietary aero middleware APIs when standardization and cross-proxy compatibility weren't being worked on.
